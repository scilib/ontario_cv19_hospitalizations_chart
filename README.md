# ontario_cv19_hospitalizations_chart
Chart hospitalizations from COVID-19 in Ottawa

A very basic Jupyter Notebook that plots Ontario COVID-19 open data, specifically for Ottawa.

Note that you can't edit Jupyter Notebooks within GitHub in any meaningful way as far as I know. However, it turns out that the Notebook file contains a fully rendered set of the last results, including any charts.

You'll need a Jupyter environment like [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/), Anaconda or Microsoft Visual Studio Code to actually edit and run the code.
